                be combined or done on separate days.

            You Need</h2>
        <div style="background-image: url(img2.jpg); background-size: 100% 100%; height: 600px;">
           <div style="width: 750px; " > <br><p>Whether your goal is to lose weight, improve your health, get in better shape,
                or all of the above, there are three main components to a good exercise program:</p>
            <ul class="clr">
                <li><b>Cardio exercise:</b> Cardio can be any activity that gets your heart rate up, from walking or
                    jogging to cycling or taking a fitness class. Regardless of the exercise, it is always smart to
                    warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio.</li> <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Weight training:</b> You don't have to lift heavy weights or even spend a lot of time on weight
                    training at
                    first, but you do need to lift. Your muscles will get stronger, helping with daily functioning, and
                    more
                    muscle mass will boost your metabolism.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <b>Flexibility training:</b> You also need to have the flexibility to go through a full range of
                    motion
                    for
                    each exercise you do. Stretching increases your flexibility and helps your body recover after
                    exercise.2
                    While some people like to set aside a day to focus on flexibility, you don't need a separate workout
                    for
                    this—stretching should be included in every workout.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Some people prefer to set a schedule with days devoted to just cardio or strength training. However,
                these
                exercises can be done on the same day or even combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) so
                long
                as you are physically fit enough and leave time for recovery.

        <p>If you've been exercising regularly for several months and do a variety of activities, you fall into this

        <ul>
            <li>Mix up your workouts to keep things interesting. As an advanced exerciser, you have lots of options for
                scheduling y
                our workouts. If you want to focus on strength and muscle, you can split your strengt
                h routine even further, doing push exercises one day and pull exercises the next.</li><br>
            <li>
                You can also make your cardio more intense. You can do this by incorporating high-intensity interval
                training, high-intensity circuit training, or other advanced techniques to burn calories and build
                endurance.
            </li><br>

                Rest and recovery are critical. The real focus should be on allowing your body to rest between
                high-intensity workouts. Too much intensity can cause injury, overtraining, and burnout.3
